# Example checkpoint list for batch evaluation
# This file contains a list of model checkpoints to evaluate

checkpoints:
  # - name: "claude-final"
  #   checkpoint_path: "/mnt/data/COMBINED/new-checkpoint/vit-patch-model-2d-embeddings-claude-suggested-weights-final-20250921_225446.pth"

  #   checkpoint_path: "/mnt/data/COMBINED/new-checkpoint/vit-patch-model-2d-embeddings-reduced-sensitivity-STEREO-final-20250921_183739.pth"


# Add more checkpoints as needed
# Each checkpoint should have:
# - name: A descriptive name for the model
# - checkpoint_path: Full path to the .ckpt or .pth file
