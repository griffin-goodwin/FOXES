# Example checkpoint list for batch evaluation
# This file contains a list of model checkpoints to evaluate

checkpoints:
  - name: "rs-epoch66"
    checkpoint_path: "/mnt/data/COMBINED/new-checkpoint/vit-patch-model-2d-embeddings-reduced-sensitivity-epoch=66-val_total_loss=0.0342.ckpt"
    
  # - name: "rs-base-epoch43"
  #   checkpoint_path: "/mnt/data/COMBINED/new-checkpoint/vit-patch-model-2d-embeddings-reduced-sensitivity-changed-base-weights-epoch=43-val_total_loss=0.0470.ckpt"
    
  # - name: "rs-epoch50"
  #   checkpoint_path: "/mnt/data/COMBINED/new-checkpoint/vit-patch-model-2d-embeddings-reduced-sensitivity-epoch=50-val_total_loss=0.0382.ckpt"

# Add more checkpoints as needed
# Each checkpoint should have:
# - name: A descriptive name for the model
# - checkpoint_path: Full path to the .ckpt or .pth file
